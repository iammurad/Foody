# ASP.NET Core N-Layer Open Source Application

This is an open-source **ASP.NET Core N-Layer Architecture** project. It implements clean architectural practices with clear separation between layers: **Presentation**, **Application**, **Domain**, and **Infrastructure**.

The application uses **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** with **Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)** as the database provider. Built-in **Dependency Injection** ensures modular, testable, and maintainable code.
